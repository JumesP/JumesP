### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm James,

I'm currently learning Javascript, SQL, PHP, Arduino/ (C++) and Java during the summer between my first and second year at the University of Winchester.

My main projects are my portfolio website, with a blog, which is a big WIP. Also some small python projects similar to my Calculator App i've just recently finished!
Currently working on 2 python projects, a Minesweeper game and Reading timer desktop application.

At Uni im currently learning NodeJS and Python for AI and Jupyter for Software testing.

Thank you for reading
