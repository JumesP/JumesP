My main projects are my portfolio website, with a blog, which is a big WIP. Also some small python projects similar to my Calculator App i've just recently finished!
Currently working on 2 python projects, a Minesweeper game and Reading timer desktop application.

At Uni im currently learning NodeJS, Python for AI and Jupyter for Software testing.
