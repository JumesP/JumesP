### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm James,

I'm currently learning Java and Javascript during the summer between my first and second year at the University of Winchester.

My main projects are my portfolio website, with a blog, which is a big WIP as well as small python projects similar to my Calculator App i've just recently finished.
