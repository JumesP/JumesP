### Hi there üëã

I'm James,

I'm currently works at Uniqodo as a FE Software Engineer Intern this summer before my Third year at the University of Winchester studying Computer Science üñ•Ô∏è.

<!--I'm currently focusing on learning Javascript while working through my second year at the University of Winchester studying Computer Science üñ•Ô∏è.-->

<!--Currently working on learning React, Typescript, Tailwind and NextJS, due to its popularity and ability to progress my Javascript skills.-->

### Recent Projects:
- a todo app (using TypeScript, React, Tailwind and MongoDB)
- Cookie Clicker clone (using Javascript, web cookies, HTML and CSS)
- Calculator App (using Python, Tkinter)
<!--My most recent main projects have been a todo app (using TypeScript, React, Tailwind and MongoDB) as well as a Cookie clicker clone to further my JS.
I've also worked on some small python projects like my Calculator App and Reading Timer.-->

All are viewable on this GitHub account, so feel free to check it out. Soon i will be working on making the README's more descriptive!

I might be slow to respond due to work and personal projects.

<!--Dispite all of this, currently on a break from coding to complete assignments!-->

Thank you for reading
