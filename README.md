### Hi there 👋

I'm James,

I'm currently focusing on learning Javascript while working through my second year at the University of Winchester studying Computer Science 🖥️.

My main projects are my portfolio website, with a blog, which is a big WIP. I've also worked on some small python projects like my Calculator App and Reading Timer!

Currently working on learning react, due to its popularity and ability to progress my Javascript skills.

At Uni im currently learning NodeJS, ExpressJS, Bootstrap, JQuery and MongoDB, and Jupyter for Software testing.

Thank you for reading
