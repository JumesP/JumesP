Currently working on learning React, Typescript, Tailwind and NextJS, due to its popularity and ability to progress my Javascript skills.

My main projects are is a todo app, using TypeScript, React, Tailwind and MongoDB. I've also worked on some small python projects like my Calculator App and Reading Timer and my cookie clicker clone!

Dispite all of this, currently on a break from coding to complete assignments!

At Uni im currently learning:
