### Hi there 👋

I'm James,

I'm currently working at Uniqodo as a FE Software Engineer Intern this summer before my Third year at the University of Winchester studying Computer Science 🖥️.

<!--I'm currently focusing on learning Javascript while working through my second year at the University of Winchester studying Computer Science 🖥️.-->

<!--Currently working on learning React, Typescript, Tailwind and NextJS, due to its popularity and ability to progress my Javascript skills.-->

### Current Projects:
- 🐟 [FishingGame](https://github.com/JumesP/FishingGame) (Using MERN stack) is a FishingGame (obviously), im creating the basics before i see where it leads
- 📕 [MyProfile](https://github.com/JumesP/MyProfile) (Using MERN stack) is a profile application, sharing what you are currently doing.
- 📆 [WhenU3](https://github.com/JumesP/WhenU3) (Using MERN stack (React Native)) an instant messaging and calendar app. (project team: [Jack](https://github.com/jack-bkr) and [Nate](https://github.com/gitnatel))
<!--My most recent main projects have been a todo app (using TypeScript, React, Tailwind and MongoDB) as well as a Cookie clicker clone to further my JS.
I've also worked on some small python projects like my Calculator App and Reading Timer.-->

### Recent Projects:
- 📃 **[a todo app](https://github.com/JumesP/todo)** (using TypeScript, React, Tailwind and MongoDB)
- 🍪 [Cookie Clicker clone](https://github.com/JumesP/CookieClicker) (using Javascript, web cookies, HTML and CSS)
- 🧮 [Calculator App](https://github.com/JumesP/Calculator-App) (using Python, Tkinter)

All are viewable on this GitHub account, so feel free to check it out. Soon i will be working on making the README's more descriptive!

I might be slow to respond due to work and personal projects.

<!--Dispite all of this, currently on a break from coding to complete assignments!-->

Thank you for reading
