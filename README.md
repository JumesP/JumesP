### Hi there 👋

I'm James,

I'm currently working at Uniqodo as a FE Software Engineer this summer before my Third year at the University of Winchester studying Computer Science 🖥️.

<!--I'm currently focusing on learning Javascript while working through my second year at the University of Winchester studying Computer Science 🖥️.-->

Currently working on learning React, Typescript, Tailwind and NextJS, due to its popularity and ability to progress my Javascript skills.

My most recent main projects have been a todo app, using TypeScript, React, Tailwind and MongoDB as well as a Cookie clicker clone.
I've also worked on some small python projects like my Calculator App and Reading Timer.

Dispite all of this, currently on a break from coding to complete assignments!

Thank you for reading
