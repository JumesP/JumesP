### Hi there üëã

I'm James,

I'm currently learning Javascript, SQL, PHP, Arduino(C++) and Java while working through my second year at the University of Winchester studying Computer Science üñ•Ô∏è.

My main projects are my portfolio website, with a blog, which is a big WIP. I've also worked on some small python projects like my Calculator App and Reading Timer i've just recently finished!

Currently working on 1 python project, a Minesweeper game and trying to brainstorm a Javascript project to improve my skills, but putting very little time into it due to my upcoming assignments due!

At Uni im currently learning NodeJS, ExpressJS, Bootstrap, JQuery and MongoDB, Python for AI and Jupyter for Software testing.

Thank you for reading
